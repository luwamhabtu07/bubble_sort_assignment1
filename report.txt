Title: Bubble Sort Implementation and Analysis

Introduction

Overview of Bubble Sort
Goals of this assignment
Basic vs. Optimized Implementation

Description of both versions
Key differences in logic
Test Case Summary

Test Case	Input	Basic Output	Optimized Output	Observations
Random Array	[5,3,8,4,2]	[2,3,4,5,8]	[2,3,4,5,8]	Works as expected
Already Sorted	[1,2,3,4,5]	[1,2,3,4,5]	[1,2,3,4,5]	Optimized stops early
Reverse Sorted	[5,4,3,2,1]	[1,2,3,4,5]	[1,2,3,4,5]	Worst case scenario
All Identical	[7,7,7,7,7]	[7,7,7,7,7]	[7,7,7,7,7]	No swaps needed
Empty Array	[]	[]	[]	Handled correctly
Single Element	[42]	[42]	[42]	Handled correctly
Time Complexity

Worst Case: O(n²) → reverse sorted
Best Case (optimized): O(n) → already sorted
Average Case: O(n²)
Space Complexity

O(1): In-place sorting
Stability

Bubble Sort is stable (maintains relative order of equal elements)
Optimization Observation

Optimized version performs fewer passes in best-case scenarios, improving performance.
Conclusion

Reinforced understanding of sorting mechanics
Optimization provides measurable benefits for pre-sorted or nearly sorted arrays
